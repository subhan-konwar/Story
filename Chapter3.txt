No one shall escape the darkness. 
Everyone shall be slain by the holysword of rightfulness.
it is fate written in the hands of everyone.
And once the supreme being makes a decision no one else than the supreme being can change it.....
in some cases it is even hard for the supreme being to be able to distinguish between right ahnd wrong.
